Hi, I'm Yiwen Yin (殷翊文), and you can also call me Even ^^

I am currently a fourth year Ph.D. student in Pervasive Human-Computer Interaction Lab at Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Prof. Yuanchun Shi and Prof. Chun Yu. My research focuses on **AI agents for task automation and collaboration**, with interests in interactive knowledge learning, task modeling, UI agents, and Human-AI alignment.
